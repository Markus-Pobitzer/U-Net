# U-Net
Own implementation of the [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) paper.

In the course [Deep Learning for Computer Vision: Seminal Work](http://www.cvg.ethz.ch/teaching/dlseminar/), you have to present a paper. Implementing the paper helped me to get a better understanding for the presented content. Compared to the original paper, I used three input channels (RGB) instead of one (grayscale) and instead of two output layers, I used one output layer in combination with a binary classifier. Otherwise, the structure is identical.
